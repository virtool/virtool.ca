## JSON Errors

JSON input that cannot be parsed, results in a <Status code={400} /> response. No more information is provided with the
response, so make sure your JSON is formatted properly!

```json
{
  "id": "invalid_json",
  "message": "Invalid JSON"
}
```

## Authorization Errors

For some endpoints, an authorized session is required. Authorized sessions are obtained by logging in through the browser.
Accessing user-specific endpoints like `GET /api/account` without an authorized session will result in the following
error:

```json
{
  "id": "requires_login",
  "message": "Requires login"
}
```

## Validation Errors

JSON input data for POST and PUT endpoints and URL queries are validated using Cerberus.

Validation errors will result in a <Status code={422} /> response. The response data includes the default
Cerberus error report. Refer to the [Cerberus documentation](http://docs.python-cerberus.org/en/stable/usage.html).

```json
{
  "id": "invalid_input",
  "message": "Invalid input",
  "errors": {
    "foo_bar": ["unknown field"],
    "new_password": ["required field"],
    "old_password": ["required field"]
  }
}
```

In this example, the `foo_bar` field is not expected in the request. The required `new_password` and
`old_password` fields are missing from the request. Refer to the input definition tables for each endpoint in the
documentation to make sure your inputs are valid.

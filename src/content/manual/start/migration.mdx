## Foreword

If you need help, please [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/virtool/virtool/issues/new?label=question).

## To Docker Compose

### Situation

You are using the old `virtool.tar.gz` installation (not Docker) and want to migrate to
Docker Compose.

### Overview

The Virtool data directory and MongoDB database need to be made available to the Docker
container.

After the migration, the built-in software update system will no longer work.

### MongoDB

First, we will deploy MongoDB as a Docker container and copy your existing database to the
container.

1. Start with a Docker Compose configuration for MongoDB.

   <CodeFile name="docker-compose.yml">

   ```yaml
   version: "3.1"
   services:
     mongo:
       image: mongo:4.0
       volumes:
         - mongo:/data/db
   volumes:
     # MongoDB data is stored in a volume.
     mongo: null
   ```

   </CodeFile>

2. Start MongoDB with Docker Compose

   ```shell
   docker compose -p virtool up -d
   ```

3. Ensure MongoDB is [configured](/docs/manual/start/installation) and running in Docker.

   You can double-check MongoDB is running by running `docker ps`. You should see
   something similar to:

   ```text
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                      NAMES
    1a2b3c4d5e6f        mongo:4.0           "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   2 hours ago         Up 2 hours
   ```

4. Stop your existing Virtool server. This will prevent any changes being made to your
   existing MongoDB database while we migrate.

5. Dump your existing MongoDB database into a file called `virtool.dump`.

   This will not affect the existing database!

   ```bash
   mongodump --db virtool --archive=virtool.dump
   ```

6. Restore the MongoDB database into the new MongoDB Docker container.

   ```bash
   docker compose exec -T mongo sh -c 'mongorestore --archive' < virtool.dump
   ```

### Virtool

Next, we will deploy Virtool as a Docker container and connect it to your existing data
directory.

The _data directory_ is the directory configured in Virtool with the `--data-path`
option.

The simplest way to make the data directory available to the Virtool Docker container is
to use a bind mount. This will map a location on your host machine to a location in the
Docker container.

1. Update the `docker-compose.yml` to include the Virtool service with a bind mount.

   <CodeFile name="docker-compose.yml">

   ```yaml
   version: "3.1"
   services:
   mongo:
      image: mongo:4.0
      volumes:
         - mongo:/data/db
   virtool:
      image: ghcr.io/virtool/virtool:LEGACY_VERSION
      command: ["python", "run.py", "--no-setup"]
      environment:
         VT_DB_CONNECTION_STRING: "mongodb://mongo:27017"
         VT_DB_NAME: "virtool"
         VT_DATA_PATH: "/data"
         VT_HOST: "0.0.0.0"
      ports:
         - "9950:9950"
      volumes:
         # Bind mount the data directory from the host machine to the container. It will
         # be located at /data in the container.
         - type: bind
         source: /mnt/virtool_data_on_host
         target: /data
   volumes:
   # MongoDB data is stored in a volume.
   mongo: null
   ```

   </CodeFile>

   Things to note:

   - We use the `--no-setup` option to skip the initial Virtool setup.
   - We use the `VT_DATA_PATH` environment variable to configure the data directory.
   - We use the `VT_DB_CONNECTION_STRING` and `VT_DB_NAME` environment variables to
     configure the MongoDB connection.
   - We define a bind mount to our existing data directory on the host machine. In this
     example it is located at `/mnt/virtool_data_on_host`.
   - The location of the data directory in the container is `/data`. This points to the
     bind mount we defined above.

2. Start Virtool with Docker Compose.

   ```shell
   docker compose -p virtool up -d
   ```

   Using `docker compose up` will bring up any new service defined in `docker-compose.yml`
   and will not affect existing services.

3. You should now be able to access Virtool at [localhost:9950](http://localhost:9950) and
   login with your existing credentials.

## To a Newer MongoDB Version

<Note color="red">
**MongoDB 3.6.0 or newer is required in Virtool 4.0.0**

- Virtool will not start if it detects that the configured database does not meet this
  requirement
- Virtool versions prior to 4.0.0 are not compatible with MongoDB 4.0.0

</Note>

### In Docker Compose

Follow these instructions if you have MongoDB running in Docker Compose.

1. Backup the Database

First, backup your database using the following command (assuming your database is
called `virtool`). This will dump the entire database to a folder that can later be
restored if necessary.

```shell
docker compose exec -T mongo sh -c 'mongodump -d virtool --archive' > virtool.dump
```

2. Check Compatibility Version using `mongo`.

   Open a Mongo shell:

   ```shell
   mongo
   ```

   In the shell, check the current `featureCompatibilityVersion` value:

   ```js
   db.adminCommand({ getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 });
   ```

   The response should contain the current version compatibility information:

   ```js
   // Nothing needs to be done in this case.
   { "featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "3.4" }, "ok" : 1 }

   // Feature compatibility must be set to 3.4 in this case.
   { "featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "3.2" }, "ok" : 1 }
   ```

3. Update Compatibility Version

   If the `version` value is not `3.4`, the compatibility version need to be updated:

   ```js
   db.adminCommand({ setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.4" });
   ```

   The `featureCompatibility` value should now be set to `3.4`. Check using:

   ```js
   db.adminCommand({ getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 });
   ```

   The response should have the value set to `3.4`.

   ```js
   { "featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "3.4" }, "ok" : 1 }
   ```

4. Update Database Software

   Install MongoDB 3.6 according to the instructions from MongoDB:

   - [Install on Ubuntu](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.6/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu)
   - [Install on Debian](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.6/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-debian)
   - [Install on SUSE](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.6/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-suse)
   - [Install on Red Hat](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.6/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-red-hat)

5. Update Compatibility Version

   The `featureCompatibilityVersion` now needs to be set to `3.6`. This process is the
   same as in **step 2** except the value is being set to `3. 6` instead of `3.4`.

   Open the Mongo shell and set the compatibility version:

   ```js
   db.adminCommand({ setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.6" });
   ```

   The `featureCompatibility` value should now be set to `3.6`. Check using:

   ```js
   db.adminCommand({ getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 });
   ```

   The response should show the `version` value set to `3.6`.

   ```js
   { "featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "3.6" }, "ok" : 1 }
   ```

### On Host

Follow these instructions if you have MongoDB running directly on the your machine. Not in
a Docker container.

1. Backup the Database

   First, backup your database using the following command (assuming your database is
   called `virtool`). This will dump the entire database to a folder that can later be
   restored if necessary.

   ```shell
   mongodump -d virtool
   ```

2. Check Compatibility Version

   Open a Mongo shell:

   ```shell
   mongo
   ```

   In the shell, check the current `featureCompatibilityVersion` value:

   ```js
   db.adminCommand({ getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 });
   ```

   The response should contain the current version compatibility information:

   ```js
   // Nothing needs to be done in this case.
   { "featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "3.4" }, "ok" : 1 }

   // Feature compatibility must be set to 3.4 in this case.
   { "featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "3.2" }, "ok" : 1 }
   ```

3. Update Compatibility Version

   If the `version` value is not `3.4`, the compatibility version need to be updated:

   ```js
   db.adminCommand({ setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.4" });
   ```

   The `featureCompatibility` value should now be set to `3.4`. Check using:

   ```js
   db.adminCommand({ getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 });
   ```

   The response should have the value set to `3.4`.

   ```js
   { "featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "3.4" }, "ok" : 1 }
   ```

   ```js
   db.adminCommand({ getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 });
   ```

   The response should show the `version` value set to `3.6`.

   ```js
   { "featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "3.6" }, "ok" : 1 }
   ```

## To Kubernetes

We haven't figured this out yet. For now, stick with Virtool 4.

## System Requirements

We recommend the following minimum specifications for running a Virtool server:

- Linux operating system
- 32 GB RAM
- 1 TB fast storage
- 1 Gb network connection

Higher CPU clock speeds and core counts will allow more operations to be run in parallel.

## Docker Compose

Docker Compose is the only supported method for installing Virtool <LegacyVersion />.

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository) and
   [the compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/#install-using-the-repository) on your Linux host.

2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to create a Virtool instance and MongoDB
   server.

   <CodeFile name="docker-compose.yml">

   ```yaml
   version: "3.1"
   services:
     mongo:
       image: mongo:3.6
       volumes:
         - mongo:/data/db
     virtool:
       image: ghcr.io/virtool/virtool:LEGACY_VERSION
       environment:
         VT_DATA_PATH: "/data"
         VT_HOST: "0.0.0.0"
       ports:
         - "9950:9950"
       volumes:
         - virtool:/data
   volumes:
     mongo: null
     virtool: null
   ```

   </CodeFile>

3. Start the services with:

   ```shell
   docker compose -p virtool up -d
   ```

   Virtool should be available on your host machine at [http://localhost:9950](http://localhost:9950).

## Explanation

Docker is a technology that allows software to be packaged into containers.

It has many advantages over traditional software installation methods:

- Containers are portable and can be run on any system that supports Docker. This prevents
  issues that arise across different operating systems.
- Containers include all the software and dependencies required to run the application.
  In Virtool's case this simplifies installation by removing the need to install
  bioinformatics tools and other dependencies.
- Upgrading the software is as simple as updating the `image` tag in the `docker-compose.yml`
  and running `docker compose -p virtool up -d`.

### Volumes

## External Software

The Dockerized version of Virtool no longer requires installation of required
bioinformatics programs. They are included in the Virtool container image.

The included software is listed for interest only.

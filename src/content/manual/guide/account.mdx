## API Keys

Virtool exposes a complete [JSON API](/docs/developer/api/account/). Access to the API is
managed using [API keys](/docs/developer/api/authentication/).

API keys are account-specific and are generated under the **API** tab in the **Account**
view.

### Create an API Key

1. Click the <DummyButton icon="key">Create</DummyButton> button to open the creation
   dialog

   Give the API key a name and select permissions you want the key to have.

   Permissions that are not granted to your account will be disabled and greyed out. If permissions are removed from your account after the key is created, they will also be removed from the key.

2. Click the <DummyButton icon="save">Save</DummyButton> button to create the key

   The key will be shown only once. Make sure you keep it somewhere safe.

   ![Newly Created API Key](@images/account/new.png)

   The key will be added to your API key list and can be removed or edited later. You
   **cannot** view the key value after creation.

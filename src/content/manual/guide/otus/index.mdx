## Overview

In Virtool, references are collections of OTUs (organization taxonomic unit), their isolates, and genomic sequences.

Virtool references are fully editable and tracked. The data is used to identify potential pathogen infections in Illumina libraries derived from your samples.

### Structure

An OTU typically represents a single pathogen species.

Each OTU is itself a collection of _isolates_. In Virtool, isolates include strains, genotypes, or variants of the same OTU. An isolate can have one or more genome sequences attached to it.

An OTU must contain one or more isolates and each isolate must have one or more sequences attached to it.

Here is the structure of a single viral OTU containing one isolate and its sequences:

### Isolate Naming

Virtool isolates are named with two pieces of information: the source type and source name. This naming system was inspired by the way isolate information is stored in Genbank records.

A **source type** is the first word in the isolate name and is a classification keyword used by the publisher of the sequence. Examples include _strain_, _genotype_, _culture_, and _variant_. The use of the **source type** keywords are not standardized in Genbank.

A **source name** is the unique second part of the isolate name that identifies the isolate.

Here are some examples of isolate names, source types, and source names:

| Name             | Source Type | Source Name |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Isolate A        | Isolate     | A           |
| Isolate Shenyang | Isolate     | Shenyang    |
| Variant B        | Variant     | B           |
| Genotype 6       | Genotype    | 6           |

### Schemas

In Virtool, OTU _schemas_ are a way of defining what each isolate in the OTU should look like.

Schemas allow you to define what sequence segments should be present in isolates created for the OTU. Once a schema is defined, users will be to mark each sequence in the isolate with the segment it represents. Assigning a segment to a sequence has the follow effects:

- sequences in the OTU detail view are sorted according to the schema order
- sequences in the OTU detail view sequence headers display the segment name instead of the definition
- sequences coverage charts in Pathoscope are sorted by the schema order

### History

All changes made to OTUs are tracked. Change records include a description of what was changed, the timestamp, and the user responsible.

The history for an OTU can be viewed in its detail view under the **History** tab. Changes are separated into those that have been made since the last index build (**Unbuilt Changes**) and those included in previous builds (**Built Changes**) by clicking on the <Icon name="history" color="blue" /> icon.

[See more information about history](/docs/manual/guide/history).

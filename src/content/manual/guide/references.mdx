## Overview

Virtool is built for detecting viruses and is capable of detecting other pathogens.
Managing collections of pathogen sequences used for this purpose is a key feature of
Virtool.

At least one non-empty reference must be created in order to start analyzing samples. One
quick way to accomplish this is to install the
[official plant virus reference](https://github.com/virtool/ref-plant-viruses).

### OTUs

The reference is a fully editable and tracked collection of pathogens, pathogen isolates, and their genome sequences.
The data in the virus reference is used to identify potential viral infections in Illumina libraries derived from
your samples.

In Virtool, pathogen records are called OTUs (organizational taxonomic unit). This leaves the organization of the
reference up to the user. Generally, OTU is synonymous with pathogen species.

See the [OTUs documentation](/docs/manual/guide/otus) for more information.

### Indexes

Indexes are versioned snapshots of all of the OTUs in a reference at points in time. In the background, indexes are
associated with optimized read mapping indices managed by Virtool.

When changes are made to OTUs, the index is rebuilt to include those changes in future analysis jobs. Each analysis is
tied to a specific index (version) of its target reference.

See the [Indexes documentation](/docs/manual/guide/indexes) for more information.

### Rights

Access to references can be controlled by user and group.

Users or groups must be assigned to a reference to gain access to it. The actions a user or group can perform on the
reference can be tightly controlled.

## Find a Reference

1. Click on <DummyLink>References</DummyLink> in the main navigation bar.

   A list of available references will appear.

   ![Reference Overview Page](/images/references/list.png)

2. Type a search term in the search bar.

   The list will be narrowed to references that contain the search term in their names.

   ![Search](/images/references/search.png)

3. Click on a reference to view detailed information about it.
   ![Detailed Information](/images/references/detail.png)

## Install the Official Reference

Instead of starting a virus database from scratch, you can use our
[official plant virus reference](https://www.virtool.ca/downloads). Doing this will setup
up **_remote_** connection to the reference on GitHub.

1. Go to the **References** view

   A message with a button for installing the official reference will be visible if you
   have not already installed it.

   ![Official Reference Placeholder](/images/references/placeholder.png)

2. Click <DummyButton>Install</DummyButton> to begin the installation process.

   A new card should appear representing the official reference on your system. It will
   display a progress bar while the reference is being created locally.

   ![Official Reference Installing](/images/references/installing.png)

   Once the installation process is complete, the reference card should look something
   like this:

   ![Reference Installation Complete](/images/references/installed.png)

3. Click the reference card to view a detail page for the reference.

   ![Installed Official Reference Detail Page](/images/references/detail.png)

## Create an Empty Reference

1. Navigate to the **References** view

   ![Reference Overview Page](/images/references/list.png)

2. Click <DummyButton icon="plus-square" /> to open the reference creation dialog.

   ![Empty Reference Box](/images/references/empty.png)

3. Give your new reference a name, the type of organism the OTUs are from (eg. viruses),
   and an optional description.

   Select a data type to tell Virtool if you will be entering whole genomes or barcode
   sequences.

   ![Filled Reference Dialog](/images/references/empty_filled.png)

4. Click <DummyButton icon="save">Save</DummyButton>.

   Your new reference will now appear in the References Overview page.

   ![Reference Overview Page](/images/references/empty_done.png)

## Clone a Reference

Existing references can be cloned to create a new reference than can be modified without affecting the original.

1. Navigate to the **References** view
   ![Reference Overview Page](/images/references/list.png)

2. Click <DummyButton icon="plus-square" /> to open the reference creation dialog.

   ![Empty Reference Box](/images/references/empty.png)

3. Click on the <DummyLink>Clone</DummyLink> tab

   The clone form has a list of existing source references to chose from. The _organism_ and _data type_ are derived
   from the source reference and cannot be changed.

   ![The clone reference form](/images/references/clone.png)

4. Fill the clone reference form

   Selecting a source reference will automatically generate a name for the reference, but this can be changed. Filling
   out the **Description** field is optional.

   ![A filled clone reference form](/images/references/clone_filled.png)

5. Click <DummyButton icon="save">Clone</DummyButton>

   The reference will be created and appear in the list. Cloning the source data takes time. The progress of this
   process is shown on the reference card.

## Update the Official Reference

The official reference is a collection of plant viruses that lets you get started using Virtool right away. It can be
automatically updated from our repository on GitHub. When changes are made to the reference on GitHub, your official
reference on Virtool also needs to be updated.

1. Go to the detail view for the official reference

   To view if any updates are required, click on your official reference. The **Remote Reference** box shows than update
   is available.

   ![Update Official Reference](/images/references/remote.png)

2. Click <DummyButton icon="download">Install</DummyButton> to install the update

   The update process will begin. The progress will be shown in the **Remote Reference** box.

   ![Remote reference update progress](remote_updating.png)

3. Wait for the update to complete

   Once the installation is complete, you will see an <Icon name="check" color="green" /> **Up-to-date** on the
   **Remote Reference** box.

   ![Remote reference is up to date](remote_updated.png)

## Build an Index

After updating the official reference there will be unbuilt changes that need to be included in an index before they can
be used in analysis. [Learn more about building indexes](/docs/manual/guide/indexes/#rebuild-index).

## Manage Source Types

Isolate names comprise a _source type_ and _source name_. Users can be forced to use certain allowed source type values
when creating isolates.

Source type restrictions do not affect OTUs from import, remote, or clone sources.

1. Go to the detail view for the reference of interest
   ![Reference detail](detail.png)

2. Go to the **Settings** tab
   ![Reference](settings_initial.png)

3. Click the **Enable** checkbox

   This will turn on source type restrictions for the reference. Users will only be able to use the source types listed
   here when creating isolates.

   ![Source type control enabled](source_types.png)

4. Enter a new source type in the input and click the <Icon name="circle-check" /> icon

   This will add the entered source type to the allowed source types for the reference. It will be available as a choice
   for users when they add isolates.

   <video

     alt="Add a source type."
     autoplay
   />

5. Click on the <Icon name="trash" color="red" /> icon on a source type to remove it

## Rights

Reference rights control what users can do with a reference.

Access to references can be configured for individual users and user groups. Users and groups added to the reference
will be able to read the reference and use it in analyses. Additional protected actions can be enabled for users and
groups after they have been added.

### Add a User

Adding a user to a reference will give them the right to browse the reference.

1. Go to the settings tabs for a reference

   ![Reference](settings_initial.png)

2. Click the <DummyLink>Add User</DummyLink> link

   The **Add User** dialog will appear. You can use the search input to filter the users on your Virtool instance.

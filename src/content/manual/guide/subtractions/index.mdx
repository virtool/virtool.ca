## Overview

Subtractions are whole genome references used for eliminating reads from analyses that are
likely to have originated from the host genome or non-pathogenic organisms associated with
the host such as insects or fungi.

A list of subtractions made can be found on the Subtraction Overview page.

   Make sure mitochondrial and chloroplast sequences are included.

2. Go to the **Subtraction** view via the main navigation bar. You should see the

## Overview

Profile hidden Markov models (HMM) are used in Virtool to discover potential novel
viruses using the [NuVs workflow](/docs/manual/sci_nuvs).

In order to use the NuVs workflow to predict novel viruses, you must first install HMM
profiles and annotations. Together these data allow NuVs to identify and annotate
sequences assembled from your sample that might comprise part of a novel viral genome.

## Install Official Data

1. Navigate to the _HMMs_ view in the main navigation bar.

   You should see something like this if no HMM data have already been installed:

   ![No HMM data found](./empty.png?url)

2. Click <DummyButton color="grey" icon="download">Install Official</DummyButton> to start
   the installation.

   It could take some time to download and install the data.

   ![Installing Official HMM Data](./installing.png?url)

3. Wait for the installation to complete.

   When the installation is complete, the HMM data will load and you will see a list of
   annotations and use the NuVs workflow.

## Explore Annotations

1. After HMM data has been installed, go to **HMM** in the main navigation bar.

   ![Browse HMMs](./list.png?url)

2. Use the search bar to find HMMs by annotative name (_eg_. RNA replicase).

3. Click on an HMM item to view its details.

   The fields in the HMM detail view describe the profile and the protein sequences that
   were used for its creation.

   | Field                | Description                                                                                                                            |
   | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Cluster**          | A unique integer identifier for the cluster                                                                                            |
   | **Best Definitions** | The three most common protein definitions found in the cluster member protein annotations.                                             |
   | **Length**           | The length of the motif identified in the profile.                                                                                     |
   | **Mean Entropy**     |                                                                                                                                        |
   | **Total Entropy**    |                                                                                                                                        |
   | **Cluster Members**  | A list of the proteins included in the cluster used to construct the profile HMM.                                                      |
   | **Families**         | The taxonomic families represented in the cluster and their cluster member counts. Cluster members without families are tagged _None_. |

## Purge HMM Data

It is possible to delete all HMM data from the disk and database. This is used primary
during testing and development.

You will be able to reinstall the HMM data once the deletion process is complete.

1. Go to **HMM** in the main navigation bar.

   ![HMM List View](./list_with_side.png?url)

2. Click on **Settings** in the left sidebar.

   ![Purge in Settings](./settings.png?url)

3. Click <DummyButton color="red" icon="trash">Purge</DummyButton> to purge the HMM data.

   You will be redirected to the HMM list view. The installation message will now be
   shown again because all HMM data has been deleted.

## Overview

History refers to the tracked changes made to OTUs. When any aspect of an OTU is changed, a history _change_ record is created.

Changes can be considered in several different contexts. One is at the OTU-level, where the changes describe the entire life of that OTU record. Changes can also be considered as a descriptor of indexes. An index can be thought of as a collection of changes to a selection of OTUs.

Here is an example of a change being recorded when an isolate is removed from an OTU:

## View OTU Changes

1. Navigate to the detail view for an OTU

   ![Detail view for ABTV](./abtv_detail.png?url)

2. Click on the **History** tab

   This shows all changes ever made to the OTU.

## Revert Changes

You can revert any **unbuilt** changes made to an OTU.

Changes included in a complete index build cannot be reverted, therefore it is a good idea to be certain of any changes before starting an index build.

1. Navigate to the detail page for an OTU

   Note that the OTU has one isolate called _Isolate Q768_.

   ![OTU Detail Page](./abtv_detail_old.png?url)

2. Click on the **History** tab to view the history for the OTU

   The history for this OTU shows that it was cloned from another reference, then one of its isolates was removed (_Q1108_) and the other was renamed from _Q767_ to _Q768_.

3. Click the <Icon name="history" color="blue" /> icon to revert a change

   Any succeeding changes will also be removed.

4. Navigate back to the **OTU** tab

   The reversions will be reflected in the OTU data. In this example, the previously removed isolate (_Q1108_) is restored and the other isolate (_Q767_) has its previous name back.

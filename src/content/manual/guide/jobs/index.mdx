## Introduction

Jobs represent long-running, resource-intensive processing tasks. All job types are related to analyzing and handling
bioinformatic data.

| Type               | Description                                                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Build Index        | Build a new index for a reference                                |
| Create Sample      | Create a sample from uploaded FASTQ data                         |
| Create Subtraction | Create a new subtraction from an uploaded genome FASTA           |
| NuVs               | Run a NuVs analysis for a sample and reference combination       |
| Pathoscope         | Run a Pathoscope analysis for a sample and reference combination |

Jobs are started when a task is started in another view (_eg_. sample creation dialog). New jobs are appended to the job
queue and start as resources become available.

## Cancel a Job

Running and waiting jobs can be cancelled. Cancellation entails forcibly stopping the job process and cleaning up any
partial job data from the database and file system.

1. Click the <Icon name="ban" color="red" /> icon on the job item

   The job will switch to a cancelled state and will release its resources and clean up any partial data.

## Delete a Job

Once a job is finished, either by completing, encountering an error, or being cancelled, its record can be deleted.

1. Click the <Icon name="trash" color="red" /> icon on a job item to delete a job

   <video src="./delete.mp4" alt="Delete job from list" autoplay />

2. Jobs can also be deleted via their detail page by clicking the <Icon name="trash" color="red" /> icon

   <video
     src="./delete_detail.mp4"
     alt="Delete job from detail page"
     autoplay
   />

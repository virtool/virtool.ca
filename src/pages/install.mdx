# Install Virtool

## Docker

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository) and
   [the compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/#install-using-the-repository) on your Linux host.
2. Write a `docker-compose.yml` similar to the following.

   This will run Virtool and MongoDB in containers and persist their data in volumes.

   ```yaml
   version: "3.1"
   services:
      mongo:
        image: mongo:3.6
         ports:
            - "27017:27017"
         volumes:
            - mongo:/data/db
      virtool:
         image: ghcr.io/virtool/virtool:4.3.1
         environment:
            VT_DATA_PATH: "/data"
            VT_HOST: "0.0.0.0"
         ports:
            - "9950:9950"
         volumes:
            - virtool:/data
   ```

3. Start the services with:

   ```shell
   docker compose -p virtool up -d
   ```

   Virtool should be available on your host machine at [http://localhost:9950](http://localhost:9950).

## Binary

The legacy method for installing Virtool is unpack and run the binary on directly on your host instead of in a container.

**This is no longer recommended**.

1. Download the latest Virtool release from the [Virtool website](http://www.virtool.ca "Virtool Website") and unpack the downloaded archive

   ```shell
   tar -xvf virtool.tar.gz
   ```

2. Move the unpacked directory to your installation location

   ```shell
   mv virtool /opt
   ```

3. Start Virtool by executing the `run` file

   ```shell
   ./run
   ```

# Install Virtool Preview

# Introduction

Jobs represent long running, resource-intensive processing tasks. All job types are related to analyzing and handling bioinformatic data.

| Type               | Description                                                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Build Index        | Build a new index for a reference                                |
| Create Sample      | Create a sample from uploaded FASTQ data                         |
| Create Subtraction | Create a new subtraction from an uploaded genome FASTA           |
| NuVs               | Run a NuVs analysis for a sample and reference combination       |
| Pathoscope         | Run a Pathoscope analysis for a sample and reference combination |

Jobs are started when a task is started in another view (_eg_. sample creation dialog). New jobs are appended to the job queue and start as resources become available.

# Cancel a Job {#cancel}

Running and waiting jobs can be cancelled. Cancellation entails forcibly stopping the job process and cleaning up any partial job data from the database and file system.

1. Click the {{< icon "ban" "red" >}} icon on the job item

   The job will switch to a cancelled state and will release its resources and clean up any partial data.

# Delete a Job {#delete}

Once a job is finished, either by completing, encountering an error, or being cancelled, its record can be deleted.

1. Click the {{< icon "trash" "red" >}} icon on a job item to delete a job

   {{< video "delete.mp4" "Delete job from list" >}}

2. Jobs can also be deleted via their detail page by clicking the {{< icon "trash" "red" >}} icon
